# Benchmarker

Runs a prime finding algorithm on 5 different languages to determine their performance.

## Installation

1. Run `$ git clone https://github.com/asplunds/benchmarker.git`
2. Download and install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## Usage

Run `$ docker-compose up`.
Wait for the program to build and then the output will appear in the `output` directory in the project root.

## Contributing

Feel free to add languages, follow the exact same algorithm as the other languages and make sure to output the results correctly.

## Notes

This is not a comprehensive benchmark. This only tests the languages in a specific test. Do not use this to draw conclusions about the overall performance of any language.
